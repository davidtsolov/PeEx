# JUNIOR DEVOPS ENGINEER

## Support an existed Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) flow

### Description 
1. Create a starter pipeline for the programming language of choice based on the given examples: [Creating your first Pipeline (jenkins.io)](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/tour/hello-world/) or use the following task artifact: [Support an existed Continuous Integration (CI) flow](https://confluence.softserveinc.com/display/SDO/Support+an+existed+Continuous+Integration+%28CI%29+flow).
2. Add new stages to the existing pipeline, which will perform a sample application packaging [GitHub - becosta/python-sample-app: python-sample-app is a starter template for new python applications](https://github.com/becosta/python-sample-app). This sample repository contains instructions on uploading a package to [PyPI · The Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/).

### Expected effort 
4 hours 
 
### Acceptance criteria 
* The pipeline should contain at least 2 stages, each of which should contain at least 2 steps. 
 
### Pre-requirements (out of the task scope and can be used from a project or reference to another NEBo task)
* Running Jenkins instance (single master), e.g, as a container locally
 
### References and tutorials 
* [Creating your first Pipeline (jenkins.io)](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/tour/hello-world/)
* [Pipeline examples (jenkins.io)](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/tour/hello-world/#examples)
* [Running multiple steps (jenkins.io)](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/tour/running-multiple-steps/)
* [PyPI · The Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/)
